X RUSSIAN translation thanks to Anton Roslavsky

	X all the methods that use setText() of Swing components need to be organized in a method called setLangText() ;
	X when the language is changed called that method on required objects 

X ITALIAN translation thanks to Dino Michelon (and revised by Martello Giorgio)

X POLISH translation thanks to Marcin Woloszczuk (Marcin Wo\u0142oszczuk)

X CZECH translation thanks to Petr Sigut (Petr \u0160igut)

-----
FIXES
-----
X When a MIDI file is open and "VIEW midi events" have been chosen, when any checkBox is clicked it plays/stops the MIDI
	this BUG also happens with version 0.4.2 (not fixing bugs on previous versions !!!)

x Fix CASE SENSITIVE files names (LICENSE.TXT is converted to license.txt under LINUX)

x Fix DGuitar.sh file so it keeps the +X flag and correct format 

X [ 1188181 ] DGuitar Log Window is Black Text on Black on OS X
	ScrollTextPanel.java was changed 
		jTextArea1.setBackground(new Color(168,152,144)) ;
		
X When there is a WHITE COLOR TRACK display that color to BLACK	
	otherwise the MusicCursor will not be VISIBLE (background at this moment is also WHITE)
		

X REMOVE COPY-RIGHTED SONGS !?!?!?
	X Remove all the popular/well know songs from this and next official releases 

X When CLOSING DGuitar with MINIMIZED windows, produces a ClassCastException

X When opening a http:// file...and not conncected to internet
	X CATCH this error "java.net.UnknownHostException: www.HOST.com" and 
	show a message "please make sure you are connected to internet, since HOST was not found"

X create the correct icon for the 128th duration note (5 colas)
	X include/test that ICON on the COLOR options

X Playing a *.GTP file (KANSAS_DUSTINTHEWIND.GTP) is causing this error :
	java.util.NoSuchElementException
		at java.util.LinkedList$ListItr.next(Unknown Source)
		at dguitar.adaptors.guitarPro.GPAdaptor.makeSongMeasure(GPAdaptor.java:199)
		at dguitar.adaptors.guitarPro.GPAdaptor.phraseFactory(GPAdaptor.java:334)

		at dguitar.gui.SongInternalFrame.play(SongInternalFrame.java:902)
		at dguitar.gui.SongInternalFrame.actionPerformed(SongInternalFrame.java:242)

X Arrange a new windows lower that the current height, to allow menus to be seen

X Reduce the height of the Tablature Bars/Panel to fit more tracks on less VERTICAL space

X calculate performance of the ADAPTOR when the PLAY button is pressed

X let the user decide if he wants a single color for all the MusicCursors or the color of the Guitar Pro track.

X the HEIGHT of the BARPANEL is now correct (changed from GridLayout to GridBagLayout)

X When the Midi Test window is closed while playing the music is NOW stopped

X Show the max number of measures in the PlayPanel

X Correct/Expected Java vendor and version is now checked at the begining of loading (warning produced)

	This was damaged when GTP decoding was introduced
	
X Cursors now also work on *.GTP files

X Fix this Drag and Drop errors
	X when the DRAG starts, the window flashes under Windows(more testing)
		This is caused when the dragged begins in the foreing window, not over DGuitar window
	
	X dragging files under LINUX causes this problems
